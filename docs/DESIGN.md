# Dialogue — Design and Prototype Conventions

## Figma source

Primary design file:

`https://www.figma.com/design/mInH5kB39oFt2FEE7kEF8I/Idealogue-WIP`

Dialogue section/page references used during prototyping include the Dialogue App views and owner/project/settings/modal screens.

## Typography

Primary UI typeface: Inter Tight.

Use the actual intended weights rather than browser-synthesized approximations. For example, SemiBold should be `font-weight: 600`.

The browser prototype uses `font-synthesis: none` to avoid synthetic weights.

## Breadcrumbs

Figma uses the rightwards arrow character conceptually (`U+2192`, `→`). Because some Google Fonts CSS subsets can omit that glyph and trigger a fallback font, the current prototype renders the separator as a small inline SVG vector for visual consistency.

Breadcrumb links remain un-underlined; hover/focus/active states use colour changes.

## Interaction conventions

Current prototype behaviors that should be preserved unless designs change:

- primary buttons such as Create/Share scale to 105% on pointer hover
- project/prototype tiles scale to 102% on pointer hover
- project/prototype tiles also receive a soft lift/shadow
- prototype tile title and edited date/time are stacked on separate lines
- meatball menu remains independently aligned at the right edge
- Copy in the Share modal changes to `Copied!` for 3 seconds, then returns to `Copy`
- New Project and Profile modals use 100ms ease-out motion
- opening motion moves the modal 16px upward into position
- closing motion moves it 16px downward while fading out
- clicking the modal backdrop closes it
- close buttons close the modal
- reduced-motion preferences disable modal animation

## Assets

Use supplied/exported Figma SVG and PNG assets where available rather than recreating them in CSS.

Current examples include:

- Dialogue wordmark
- project badges
- sidebar icons
- save heart
- upload control
- New badge
- profile arrow
- meatball menu
- Landline prototype thumbnail PNG
- Landline full-size prototype PNG

## Prototype tile clipping

Rounded tile surfaces should keep radius/clipping on a dedicated inner surface, while scale/shadow transforms are applied to the outer wrapper. This avoids Safari/WebKit anti-aliasing seams and grey edge artifacts during scaling.

## Public Share shell

The prototype public Share shell is intentionally minimal and HTML/CSS-only. Do not add JavaScript to that shell unless the product/design decision changes.

## Fidelity principle

When implementation and screenshots differ, use Figma measurements/assets/typography as the primary visual reference. Avoid inventing missing product UI; wait for or request the relevant design where necessary.
